        <p><strong><font size="4">About Anne Penman</font></strong></p>
        <p>Before she started helping thousands of people quit smoking through 
          the laser therapy centers that bear her name, Anne Penman was a three-pack-a-day 
          smoker with little hope for finding a way to quit the habit herself. 
          <img src="images/annepenman1.jpg" width="200" height="185" align="left"><br>
          Currently based in Glasgow, Scotland, Anne and her husband, Ron, originally 
          worked together in Ireland, helping to run her family's business - a 
          tavern. Both were long-time smokers working in an environment that helped 
          to perpetuate their habit. In 1987, Ron suffered his first major heart 
          attack at the age of 37. Despite this serious health scare, both Anne 
          and Ron continued to smoke. Ron's health continued to decline when in 
          1991 he suffered a massive heart attack and underwent triple bypass 
          surgery. The wake-up call was not ignored by Ron this time (he has been 
          a non smoker since Feb. 14, 1991), but Anne found quitting much more 
          difficult. </p>
        <p>Informed by her husband's doctors that she would need to quit smoking 
          and support her husband if she wanted to keep him alive, Anne tried 
          all methods available at the time - including, hypnosis, acupuncture, 
          and Nicorette chewing gum - with no success. Desperate to quit, Anne 
          tried laser therapy as a last resort, and on April 19, 1991, was able 
          to quit smoking. </p>
        <p>Inspired by her own experiences, Anne developed a passion to help others 
          who felt as hopeless as she did about quitting the habit. She trained 
          as a laser technician in June 1991 and soon began to develop her unique 
          Program, which combines laser therapy with personalized guidance and 
          advice, as well as a 24-hour helpline. She became a practicing smoking-cessation 
          advisor in 1992 and opened up her first smoking cessation laser center 
          in Glasgow, Scotland. </p>
        <p>In those early days, Penman's business grew almost entirely by referral 
          business - a testament to the effectiveness of her program. Branching 
          out from her core consumer-based business, Penman created relationships 
          in the corporate sector, hospitals and medical centers. Today, Anne 
          Penman is considered a pioneer in the field, a notoriety that has helped 
          her to grow her business throughout the United Kingdom, and to expand 
          her reach by training technicians in Europe, from Denmark to Portugal.<br>

          the habit</a>.</p>
